7. **Knapsack Problem**
   - **Description:** Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(nW) where W is the maximum weight
